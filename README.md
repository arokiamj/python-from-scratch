### Learn python from scratch

According to the latest [TIOBE Programming Community Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/?source=post_page---------------------------),  Python is one of the top 10 popular programming languages of 2017. Python is a general purpose and high level programming language. You can use Python for developing desktop GUI applications, websites and web applications. 

Also, Python, as a high level programming language, allows you to focus on core functionality of the application by taking care of common programming tasks. The simple syntax rules of the programming language further makes it easier for you to keep the code base readable and application maintainable

There are many advantages of Python that help you get results fast within the field of web development:


* Python [has a large selection of pre-built libraries](https://stxnext.com/blog/2018/09/20/most-popular-python-scientific-libraries/)  for just about anything.
Scientific computing, image processing, data processing, machine learning, deep learning—you name it, Python has it.

* Python code takes less time to write due to its simple and clean syntax.
Because of this, code written in Python lends itself very well to [creating quick prototypes](https://stxnext.com/blog/2018/05/08/5x5-5-tips-building-successful-minimum-viable-product-5-weeks/)


* Python has [a built-in framework for unit tests](https://stxnext.com/blog/2018/06/21/measurable-benefits-unit-testing/)
This helps you ship bug-free code.


In addition to Python’s standard features, one of its major strengths in web development is [the variety of web frameworks it offers](https://stxnext.com/blog/2018/09/27/beginners-introduction-python-frameworks/)

With a large selection of well-supported frameworks, you can find the right starting point for any project. Python gives you the tools to get the job done reliably, no matter whether you’re looking to focus on:

* fast-to-implement and out-of-the-box solutions,
* solutions that require many specialized microservices working together,
* an app where performance is crucial.
